Even that bold blue is an Air Max 1 staple. The insole's warped-clock graphic confirms that this shoe is indeed a distortion of time and space. Go ahead and pinch yourself. It's a sneakerhead's dream, come true.From tough stitching to pristine materials to the cupsole design, these kicks deliver durable style that\u2019s smoother than backboard glass.Originally designed for performance hoops, Nike Air cushioning delivers lasting comfort.Low-cut, padded collar looks sleek and feels great.Rubber outsole with pivot circles adds durable traction and heritage style.",
